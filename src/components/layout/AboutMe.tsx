      <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
        I was first introduced to web development in 2019. However, it wasn't
        until 2023, after high school, that I began to take it seriously. Over
        the next eight months, I taught myself through various online resources.
        I was inspired by the achievements one can make in the tech industry
        and, luckily, coding came more naturally to me than the "Physics,
        Chemistry, and Mathematics" combination I took in high school. Despite
        how ambitious I was, I couldn't meet my expectations of how quickly I
        wanted to progress due to my bad learning habits and inconsistencies.
        Joining "The Gym" in April 2024 was a transformative experience for me
        as it was my first time working in a professional setting. Since then,
        I've been more consistent, training my brain to handle the 50+ hours
        work weekly. Fun fact, we call it, “To build the muscle,” hence the name
        “The Gym.” Aside from coding, I enjoy learning about human relations and
        business. I express myself through music in various ways, such as
        singing and playing the piano. I also have plans to join a dance class.
        I'm a movie enthusiast who values sleep just as much. I often take long
        night walks for some alone time, just to think. ~ Growth🌱
